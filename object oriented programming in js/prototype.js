//  fisrt of all
// __proto__ or [[prototype]]is a diffrent thing and prototype is completely a diffrent thing



//  we can treat function as function as well as object
//  we can use property like we use in object
//  for ex
function hello(){
    console.log("hy");
}

//  like we use method n objet we can also use that property in functions also

console.log(hello.name);
// or we can create our own property
 hello.myownproperty="very unique value"
//  and we cann see that also

// console.log(hello.myownproperty);

// funcutions proviedes free sace  which is prototype

// console.log(hello.prototype);

// only functions provide   prototype propertie
